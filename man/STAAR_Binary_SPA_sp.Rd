\arguments{
\item{genotype_sp}{a sparse genotype matrix (dgCMatrix) of dimension n*p,
where n is the sample size and p is the number of genetic variants.
The matrix should be extracted using \code{\link{Genotype_sp_extraction}},
and it has been flipped: only the minor allele is stored (coded as 1), while the major allele is not stored (coded as 0).}

\item{MAF}{a numeric vector of minor allele frequencies for the variants in \code{genotype_sp}.
It can be computed as \code{MAC / (2 * n)} using \code{Matrix::colSums(genotype_sp)} to obtain MAC,
where \code{n} is the number of samples.}

\item{obj_nullmodel}{an object from fitting the null model, which is the
output from either \code{\link{fit_null_glm}} function for unrelated samples or
\code{\link{fit_null_glmmkin}} function for related samples. Note that \code{\link{fit_null_glmmkin}}
is a wrapper of the \code{\link{glmmkin}} function from the \code{\link{GMMAT}} package.}

\item{annotation_phred}{a data frame or matrix of functional annotation data
of dimension p*q (or a vector of a single annotation score with length p).
Continuous scores should be given in PHRED score scale, where the PHRED score
of j-th variant is defined to be -10*log10(rank(-score_j)/total) across the genome. (Binary)
categorical scores should be taking values 0 or 1, where 1 is functional and 0 is
non-functional. If not provided, STAAR will perform the
Burden(1,25) and Burden(1,1) tests (default = NULL).}

\item{rare_maf_cutoff}{the cutoff of maximum minor allele frequency in
defining rare variants (default = 0.01).}

\item{rv_num_cutoff}{the cutoff of minimum number of variants of analyzing
a given variant-set (default = 2).}

\item{rv_num_cutoff_max}{the cutoff of maximum number of variants of analyzing
a given variant-set (default = 1e+09).}

\item{tol}{a positive number specifying tolerance, the difference threshold for parameter
estimates in saddlepoint apporximation algorithm below which iterations should be stopped (default = ".Machine$double.eps^0.25").}

\item{max_iter}{a positive integers pecifying the maximum number of iterations for applying the saddlepoint approximation algorithm (default = "1000").}

\item{SPA_p_filter}{logical: are only the variants with a normal approximation based p-value smaller than a pre-specified threshold use the SPA method to recalculate the p-value, only used for imbalanced case-control setting (default = FALSE).}

\item{p_filter_cutoff}{threshold for the p-value recalculation using the SPA method, only used for imbalanced case-control setting (default = 0.05)}
}
\value{
A list with the following members:

\code{num_variant}: the number of variants with minor allele frequency > 0 and less than
\code{rare_maf_cutoff} in the given variant-set that are used for performing the
variant-set using STAAR.

\code{cMAC}: the cumulative minor allele count of variants with
minor allele frequency > 0 and less than \code{rare_maf_cutoff} in the given variant-set.

\code{RV_label}: the boolean vector indicating whether each variant in the given
variant-set has minor allele frequency > 0 and less than \code{rare_maf_cutoff}.

\code{results_STAAR_B}: the STAAR-B p-value that aggregated Burden(1,25) and Burden(1,1) together
with p-values of each test weighted by each annotation using Cauchy method.

\code{results_STAAR_B_1_25}: a vector of STAAR-B(1,25) p-values,
including Burden(1,25) p-value weighted by MAF, the Burden(1,25)
p-values weighted by each annotation, and a STAAR-B(1,25)
p-value by aggregating these p-values using Cauchy method.

\code{results_STAAR_B_1_1}: a vector of STAAR-B(1,1) p-values,
including Burden(1,1) p-value weighted by MAF, the Burden(1,1)
p-values weighted by each annotation, and a STAAR-B(1,1)
p-value by aggregating these p-values using Cauchy method.

\description{
The \code{STAAR_Binary_SPA_sp} function is a sparse matrix (dgcMatrix) version of \code{STAAR_Binary_SPA}.
It takes in a sparse genotype matrix, the object from fitting the null model, and functional annotation data
to analyze the association between a imbalanced case-control phenotype and a variant-set by using STAAR-SPA procedure.
For each variant-set, the STAAR-B p-value is a p-value from an omnibus test
that aggregated Burden(1,25) and Burden(1,1) together with p-values of each test weighted by each annotation
using Cauchy method.
